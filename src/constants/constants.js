    description: "Worked on a project known as COVID19 DETECTION USING VGG16.I worked on this project after attending the workshop that has been done by Vimal Daga sir under IIEC rise community. I came to know about VGG16 network which can be used to detect whether from the scanned XRAY image whether a person is infected with Corona or not. I got an accuracy of about 98.6% while training the model.",

    title: 'INTEGRATION OF DEEP LEARNING MODEL WITH CI/CD OPERATIONS',
    description: "Training the model in Deep Learning is not a big deal, but changing the hyper-parameters for getting a better accuracy matters a lot which is a tedious process.This Article Covers a great Problem Statement that how we can automate the Deep Learning so that it can achieve a High Accuracy, Less Training Time and Less Resources automatically without any human intervention.This reduces the tedious work that has to be done by the humans",

    description: "This Recommender System recommends movies similar to the movie user likes and analyses the sentiments on the reviews given by the user for that movie.The details of the movies(title, genre, runtime, rating, poster, etc) are fetched using an API by TMDB and using the IMDB id of the movie in the API, I did web scraping to get the reviews given by the user in the IMDB site using beautifulsoup4 and performed sentiment analysis on those reviews.",
