    description: "Worked on a project known as COVID19 DETECTION USING VGG16.I worked on this project after attending the workshop that has been done by Vimal Daga sir under IIEC rise community. I came to know about VGG16 network which can be used to detect whether from the scanned XRAY image whether a person is infected with Corona or not. I got an accuracy of about 98.6% while training the model.",

    title: 'INTEGRATION OF DEEP LEARNING MODEL WITH CI/CD OPERATIONS',
    description: "Training the model in Deep Learning is not a big deal, but changing the hyper-parameters for getting a better accuracy matters a lot which is a tedious process.This Article Covers a great Problem Statement that how we can automate the Deep Learning so that it can achieve a High Accuracy, Less Training Time and Less Resources automatically without any human intervention.This reduces the tedious work that has to be done by the humans",
